Outside of Colab you'll also notice comments in code cells that look like #@something, these trigger special Colab functionality but don't change the behavior of the notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Service Usage API\n",
    "* Vertex AI Extensions\n",
    "* Vertex AI Agent Builder\n",

    "* Google Cloud Storage Client\n",
    "* Google Drive API Client\n",
    "* Gmail API Client\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has been tested in the following environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python version = 3.10.12 & 3.12.0\n",
    "* [google-cloud-aiplatform](https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-aiplatform/) version = 1.47.0\n",

    "\n",
    "🗒 **Please note: the optional section near the end of this notebook shows how to use Google's Workspace APIs to save a PDF report to your Google Drive and to send an email with the attached PDF. Using the Workspace APIs requires setting up an OAuth consent screen and going through a web-based authentication flow. Many remote notebook environments, including Colab and Juypterlab, don't support this out-of-the-box. If you want to run through the optional section, make sure you are running this notebook in an environment that can open a webpage that you can interact with, like a local development environment.**"

    "## Useful Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This notebook uses Generative AI cababilities. Re-running a cell that uses Generative AI capabilities may produce similar but not identical results.\n",
    "2. Because of #1, it is possible that an output from Code Interpreter producess errors. If that happens re-run the cell that produced the coding error. The different generated code will likely be bug free. The `run_code_interpreter` method below helps automate this, but you still may need to rerun cells that generate working code that doesn't perfectly follow the instructions in the prompt.\n",
    "3. The use of Extensions and other Generative AI capabilities is subject to service quotas. Running the notebook using \"Run All\" may exceed  your queries per minute (QPM) limitations. Run the notebook manually and if you get a quota error pause for up to 1 minute before retrying that cell. Code Interpreter defaults to Gemini on the backend and is subject to the Gemini quotas, [view your Gemini quotas here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas?pageState=(%22allQuotasTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%257B_22k_22_3A_22_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22base_model_5C_22_22%257D_2C%257B_22k_22_3A_22_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22gemini_5C_22_22%257D%255D%22%29%29&e=13802955&mods=logs_tg_staging).\n",
    "4. The Code Interpreter Extension is stateless and therefore every request to Code Interpreter does not have knowledge of previous operations nor files injested or produced in previous steps. Therefore, with any request to Code Interpreter you need to submit all files and instructions for that request to complete successfully.\n",
    "5. The Code Interpreter runs in a sandbox environment. So try to avoid prompts that need additional Python packages to run, or prompt Code Interpreter to ignore anything that needs packages beyond the built-in ones.\n",
    "6. Tell Code Interpreter to catch and print any exceptions for you, and to suppress UserWarnings and FutureWarnings.\n",
    "7. For debugging the output of Code Interpreter, it usually helps to copy the error message into the prompt and tell Code Interpreter to properly handle that error.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can take a look at [this section](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VCc78QwQLFCi0-C0nrniNx1A2oETPzJI?resourcekey=0-qNxm5xjjWT5sAcpe1gnaQA#scrollTo=Q0ntCZvlY0sH&line=1&uniqifier=1) as an example for points 5-7."
