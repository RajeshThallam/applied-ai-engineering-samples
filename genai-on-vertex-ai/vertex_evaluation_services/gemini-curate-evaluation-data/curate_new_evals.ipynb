    "Deploying a chatbot or retrieval augmented generation (RAG) application to real users provides a wealth of valuable data.

    "This notebook demonstrates how to leverage Gemini to accelerate the analysis and summarization of real user queries from a production RAG system or chatbot. By analyzing these queries, we can identify a representative set of questions to form an evaluation dataset, establishing a foundation for continuous evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This process aims to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What general categories of questions are users asking? What problems are they encountering?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What topics are prevalent in user conversations?\n",

Gemini's large context window allows for rapid exploratory data analysis (EDA) of clustered questions, even with extensive datasets, facilitating efficient metadata extraction and informed selection of an evaluation dataset.  This, in turn, enables the construction of a robust and representative evaluation set for the RAG system."

    "\n",
    "With this notebook you can go from a mass of user queries from a RAG system and get immediate insights into the types of queries people are asking with useful clusters of queries described and analyzed by Gemini. This analysis can help inform decisions around how to improve the RAG system or it may highlight other issues in the business or product beyond what the chatbot can address. Finally, you can sample queries from these clusters to get a representative set of evaluation questions with which you can use to continuously evaluate the RAG system over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a next step will be to take this set of representative questions and obtain ground truth from users or subject matter experts and then evaluating performance using a service like [Vertex AI Evaluation Service](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/evaluation-overview)."
